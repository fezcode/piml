# PIML (Parenthesis Intended Markup Language) Definition

**Spec version**: v1.1.0

Libraries are listed in [LIBRARIES](./LIBRARIES.md) file.

## 1. Introduction

PIML (Parenthesis Intended Markup Language) is a data serialization format designed to be exceptionally human-readable and writable, while maintaining a clear and unambiguous structure for machine parsing.

It uses `(key)` syntax and indentation-based nesting to create a clean and visually intuitive representation of data. It is intended as an alternative to formats like JSON, YAML, and TOML, striking a balance between machine-friendliness and human-friendliness.

This document defines the PIML specification, version 1.0.

## 2. Syntax Rules

### 2.1. Keys

Keys are enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `(my key)`. Keys can contain spaces and most characters.

### 2.2. Indentation

Consistent indentation is crucial for defining structure.

* **Recommendation:** Use **2 spaces** for each level of indentation.
* **Rule:** Mixing tabs and spaces for indentation is **not allowed**.

### 2.3. Comments

A line is considered a comment only if it **starts with** a `#`. The entire line is then ignored by the parser. Inline comments are not supported.

```piml
# This is a valid comment
(key) This is a value, and # is part of it
```

### 2.4. Escaping

Backslash (`\`) is used for escaping characters within string values.

* Common escapes: `\n` (newline), `\t` (tab), `\\` (literal backslash).
* If a string value needs to contain `(` or `#`, it can be escaped, e.g., `(title) My \(Awesome\) Title`.

## 3. Data Types

### 3.1. Primitive Types

* **Single-line Strings:** Unquoted strings that fit on a single line.
  ```piml
  (greeting) Hello, World!
  ```
* **Integers:** Whole numbers.
  ```piml
  (age) 30
  ```
* **Floats:** Decimal numbers.
  ```piml
  (price) 99.99
  ```
* **Booleans:** Logical values.
  ```piml
  (is_active) true
  (is_enabled) false
  ```

### 3.2. Null and Empty Representations

PIML uses `nil` as a unified value to represent three distinct states:

1.  **Null:** The absence of a value (equivalent to `null` in JSON).
2.  **Empty Array:** An empty list (equivalent to `[]` in JSON).
3.  **Empty Object:** An empty map (equivalent to `{}` in JSON).

```piml
(optional_field) nil
(empty_list) nil
(empty_config) nil
```

This is a deliberate design choice for simplicity, prioritizing a clean syntax over the ability to distinguish between empty collection types.

### 3.3. Multi-line Strings

Strings that span multiple lines. The content starts on the next indented line.

*   **Line Preservation:** Newlines, including empty or whitespace-only lines, are preserved.
*   **Escaping:** To include a `#` at the beginning of a line, you must escape it with a backslash (`\`).

```piml
(long_description)
    This is a multi-line string.

    It can contain several lines of text, including blank ones.
    \# This line starts with a hash but is not a comment.
```

### 3.4. Arrays (Lists)

A collection of ordered items, denoted by `>` at the start of each indented line.

```piml
(my_list)
    > item1
    > item2
    > item3
```

### 3.5. Sets (Not Implemented)

A collection of unique, unordered items, denoted by `>|`.

```piml
(unique_tags)
    >| tag_a
    >| tag_b
    >| tag_c
    >| tag_a # This duplicate will be ignored
```

**Note:** A parser should discard duplicate values. The order of items in a set is not guaranteed.

### 3.6. Objects (Maps)

A collection of unordered key-value pairs, defined by indentation.

```piml
(user_profile)
    (name) Alice
    (email) alice@example.com
```

#### 3.6.1. List of Objects

A list containing objects follows a specific syntax combining the Array (`>`) and Key (`()`) markers.

```piml
(contributors)
    > (contributor)
        (id) 1
        (name) Alice
        (role) Developer
    > (contributor)
        (id) 2
        (name) Bob
        (role) Tester
```

**Rule:** The `(item_key)` (e.g., `(contributor)`) is considered **metadata for readability only**, similar to a comment. A parser must ignore this key and simply interpret the indented block as an object within the list.

### 3.7. Specialized Types (by Convention)

* **Dates/Times:** Represented as strings, conventionally in ISO 8601 format.
  ```piml
  (timestamp) 2023-10-27T10:30:00Z
  ```
* **Binary Data:** Represented as base64-encoded strings.
  ```piml
  (binary_data) SGVsbG8gV29ybGQ=
  ```

```

### 4.2. Example: Keys with Spaces

This example demonstrates the use of keys that contain spaces, enhancing readability.

```piml
(user profile)
    (first name) John
    (last name) Doe
    (date of birth) 1990-05-15
    (favorite colors)
        > red
        > blue
        > green
    (contact info)
        (email address) john.doe@example.com
        (phone number) +1-555-123-4567
    (is active) true
    (last login) 2023-10-27T15:00:00Z
```

### 4.3. Example: JSON to PIML Conversion

This section illustrates how a typical JSON structure would be represented in PIML.

#### Original JSON:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "PIML Converter",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "active": true,
    "description": "A tool to convert JSON to PIML and vice versa. This description is quite long and spans multiple lines.",
    "tags": ["parser", "converter", "data format"],
    "contributors": [
      { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "role": "Developer" },
      { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "role": "Tester" }
    ],
    "settings": {},
    "last_updated": null,
    "release date": "2023-10-27T16:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

#### Equivalent PIML:

```piml
(project)
    (name) PIML Converter
    (version) 1.0.0
    (active) true
    (description)
        A tool to convert JSON to PIML and vice versa.
        This description is quite long and spans multiple lines.
    (tags)
        > parser
        > converter
        > data format
    (contributors)
        > (contributor)
            (id) 1
            (name) Alice
            (role) Developer
        > (contributor)
            (id) 2
            (name) Bob
            (role) Tester
    (settings) nil # Represents {}
    (last_updated) nil # Represents null
    (release date) 2023-10-27T16:00:00Z
```

## 5. Comparison with Other Formats

PIML is designed to offer a specific set of trade-offs compared to other popular formats.

### 5.1. vs. JSON

* **PIML Advantages:**
    * **Readability:** Far less verbose for humans. No need for quotes on keys or single-line strings, and no trailing commas.
    * **Comments:** Supports native `#` comments.
    * **Multi-line Strings:** Cleaner, native multi-line string support without `\n`.
* **PIML Trade-off:**
    * **Ambiguity:** PIML's use of `nil` for null, `[]`, and `{}` is simpler to write but means it cannot perfectly round-trip all JSON data, as the distinction between empty collections is lost.

### 5.2. vs. YAML

* **PIML Advantages:**
    * **Simplicity:** PIML has a much smaller, more constrained syntax, avoiding the "many ways to do one thing" complexity of YAML.
    * **Explicit Keys:** The `(key)` syntax is unambiguous and easy for both humans and parsers to identify, avoiding YAML's "significant whitespace" pitfalls.
* **PIML Trade-off:**
    * **Advanced Features:** PIML lacks (by design) advanced YAML features like anchors, aliases, and document-start/end markers.

### 5.3. vs. TOML

* **PIML Advantages:**
    * **Nesting:** PIML's indentation-based nesting is more natural for arbitrarily deep data structures than TOML's `[table]` and `[[array of tables]]` syntax.
* **PIML Trade-off:**
    * **Configuration Focus:** TOML is explicitly designed for configuration files and can be clearer for very flat "config" style data. PIML is a more general-purpose data model.
